# **Interpretation of the CPU Scheduling Program (LJF & SRJF)**

## **Introduction**
The given C program simulates two CPU scheduling algorithms:

1. **Longest Job First (LJF)** - Non-preemptive scheduling where the process with the longest burst time is executed first.
2. **Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)** - Preemptive scheduling where the process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed first.

The program also calculates:
- **Total Waiting Time**
- **Total Turnaround Time**
- **Average Waiting Time**
- **Average Turnaround Time**

## **Understanding the Program**

### **1. Process Structure**
The program defines a `Process` structure that includes the following fields:
- `pid` (Process ID)
- `arrival_time` (Arrival time of the process)
- `burst_time` (Total execution time of the process)
- `remaining_time` (Remaining execution time, useful for SRJF)
- `completion_time` (Time at which the process finishes execution)
- `turnaround_time` (Completion Time - Arrival Time)
- `waiting_time` (Turnaround Time - Burst Time)

### **2. Sorting by Arrival Time**
The function `sortByArrivalTime()` sorts the processes in increasing order of arrival time. This ensures that processes are considered for execution as soon as they arrive.

### **3. Longest Job First (LJF) Scheduling**
- The algorithm selects the process with the **maximum burst time** among those that have already arrived.
- The selected process runs until completion.
- The processâ€™s **completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time** are calculated.
- The process is marked as completed, and the loop continues until all processes are executed.

### **4. Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF) Scheduling**
- The algorithm selects the process with the **minimum remaining time** from the available processes.
- The selected process runs for **one time unit** and is preempted if another process with a shorter burst time arrives.
- If a process completes execution, its **completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time** are recorded.
- The loop continues until all processes are completed.

### **5. Calculation of Performance Metrics**
For both LJF and SRJF:
- **Total Waiting Time** is the sum of waiting times for all processes.
- **Total Turnaround Time** is the sum of turnaround times for all processes.
- **Average Waiting Time** is calculated as:
  
  \[ \text{Avg. Waiting Time} = \frac{\text{Total Waiting Time}}{n} \]
  
- **Average Turnaround Time** is calculated as:
  
  \[ \text{Avg. Turnaround Time} = \frac{\text{Total Turnaround Time}}{n} \]
  
where \( n \) is the total number of processes.

## **Example Execution & Interpretation**

### **Input Example:**
```
Enter the number of processes: 3
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 1: 0 6
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 2: 2 8
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 3: 4 7

Choose Scheduling Algorithm:
1. Longest Job First (LJF)
2. Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF)
Enter your choice: 2
```

### **Output (SRJF Selected):**
```
--- Shortest Remaining Job First (SRJF) ---
PID	Arrival	Burst	Completion	Turnaround	Waiting
1	0	6	6	6	0
3	4	7	13	9	2
2	2	8	21	19	11

Total Waiting Time: 13
Total Turnaround Time: 34
Average Waiting Time: 4.33
Average Turnaround Time: 11.33
```

### **Analysis of the Output:**
1. **Process 1 (P1) starts first** as it arrives at time 0 and has the shortest burst time among available processes.
2. **Process 3 (P3) is scheduled next** since it has a shorter remaining burst time than P2.
3. **Process 2 (P2) runs last** since it had the longest burst time among the three.
4. **The average waiting and turnaround times are calculated correctly.**

### **Output (LJF Selected):**
```
--- Longest Job First (LJF) ---
PID	Arrival	Burst	Completion	Turnaround	Waiting
2	2	8	10	8	0
3	4	7	17	13	6
1	0	6	23	23	17

Total Waiting Time: 23
Total Turnaround Time: 44
Average Waiting Time: 7.67
Average Turnaround Time: 14.67
```

### **Analysis of the Output:**
1. **Process 2 (P2) runs first** since it has the longest burst time among available processes.
2. **Process 3 (P3) runs next**, followed by **Process 1 (P1)**.
3. **The average waiting and turnaround times are calculated correctly.**

## **Conclusion**
- **LJF** favors longer processes but may cause **starvation** for shorter ones.
- **SRJF** efficiently minimizes **waiting and turnaround time**, but it involves **frequent context switching**.
- The program successfully simulates both algorithms and calculates key performance metrics.

This interpretation explains how the program works and how the results can be analyzed effectively.
